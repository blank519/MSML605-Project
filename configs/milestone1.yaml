# Milestone 1 configuration — all scripts read from this file.

# Fixed random seed for determinism across ingestion, splits, and pair generation. 
seed: 1

# Split policy: identities are assigned to splits so no identity appears in more than one split (identity-disjoint split).
splits:
  policy: "identity-disjoint split: identities sorted, shuffled with seed, then
    assigned 70% train / 15% val / 15% test by identity count"
  val_frac: 0.15
  test_frac: 0.15
